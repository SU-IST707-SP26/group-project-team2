**Project Title:** Predicting Obesity Using BRFSS 2024 Data

**Stakeholders:** Team members, public health researchers, CDC data users

**Problem Statement:**  
Obesity is a major public health issue. Identifying predictors from BRFSS 2024 survey data can help inform interventions and policy planning.

**Envisioned Solution:**  
- Use the BRFSS 2024 dataset to build predictive models for obesity.  
- Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.  
- Compare machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) to identify key risk factors.  
- Deliver a reproducible pipeline with clear reporting of results.
