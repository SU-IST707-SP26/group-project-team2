## 2026-02-01 - Initial Setup (Alice)
**Context:** Set up project repository and created project management files.  

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `admin/`, `work/`, `data/`, `proposal/`, `checkpoint/`, `presentation/`, `final/` folders.
- Added initial `VISION.md` and `WORKPLAN.md` with BRFSS obesity prediction tasks.

**Impact:** Repository structure ready for team collaboration.  

**Next Steps:** Team to download BRFSS 2024 data and begin EDA.

## 2026-02-01 - Data Download Started (Lulu)
**Context:** Acquiring BRFSS 2024 dataset for analysis.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Downloaded 2024 survey files and codebooks from CDC.
- Verified file formats (ASCII/SAS) and documentation.

**Impact:** Data ready for cleaning and preprocessing.

**Next Steps:** Review variables and identify target/predictors for obesity prediction.


## 2026-02-05 - Milestone 1: Data Acquisition & Understanding (Quispe)

Context:
- BRFSS 2024 codebook unavailable.
- Need to identify health-related predictors and define obesity target.

Solution Implemented:
- Loaded BRFSS 2024 dataset.
- Auto-mapped variables:
    - Health: BMI, ASTHMA, heart disease, cholesterol, diabetes, general health, mental/physical unhealthy days, insurance, dental visits
    - Demographic: Age, sex, race, education, income
    - Behavioral: Exercise, smoking, alcohol, fruit/vegetable consumption
- Defined obesity target variable (BMI ≥ 30)
- Created preliminary dataset subset for team review.
- Saved as `brfss_2024_mapped_vars.parquet`

Impact:
- Team can proceed with preprocessing without codebook.
- Health predictors and target variable ready for Milestone 2.
- Dataset subset ensures consistent predictor selection.

Next Steps:
- Begin Milestone 2: preprocessing (missing value handling, encoding, scaling, outlier detection).
- Document preprocessing decisions for reproducibility.


## 2026-02-11 - Milestone 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Quispe)

Context:
- Preprocessing health variables from BRFSS 2024 mapped dataset.
- Goal: Prepare clean, consistent data for Milestone 3 EDA and modeling.

Solution Implemented:
- Flagged health variables with >20% missing values.
- Imputed missing numeric values using median.
- Encoded ordinal variables (e.g., ASTHMA severity) with OrdinalEncoder.
- Scaled numeric features using RobustScaler to reduce outlier influence.
- Detected outliers using z-score method and flagged them.
- Saved cleaned dataset for downstream analysis as `brfss_2024_cleaned_qusipe.parquet`.

Impact:
- Health variables are now clean, scaled, and ready for exploratory analysis.
- Outlier flags allow informed decisions for modeling.
- Cleaned dataset ensures reproducibility and consistency across team members.

Next Steps:
- Perform Milestone 3 EDA:
    - Summary statistics and distributions
    - Correlations
    - PCA or feature importance analysis
    - Risk cluster visualization
